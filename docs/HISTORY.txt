Changelog for Products.PloneSoftwareCenter

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

1.5
===

- fixed a bug in uploads of packages to existing
  projects that does not have a distutils id yet
  [tarek]

- added an event that gets triggered if you change the storage
  strategy. It will migrate all files to the new storage.
  [tarek]

- added a ++simple++ namespace to provide a package index API.
  [tarek] 

- Moved content/validators.py to validators.py (with deprecation) as
  otherwise the registering of validators was too late due to the
  order of imports.  [maurits]

- Added Products.ArchAddon, Products.AddRemoveWidget and
  Products.DataGridField to the install_requires in setup.py.
  [maurits]

- added a pluggable storage mechanism for downloadable files.
  This can be used to define new storage strategies in independant
  packages. They will then be available in PloneSoftwareCenter
  instances, under the new "storage strategy" field.

  PSC provides a default strategy called `archetype` that uses
  a regular ZODB persistency.

  Other strategies are available like collective.psc.externalstorage.
  [tarek]

- Made the workflow of releases aware of development tags created by distutils
  so if an egg has "dev" or an SVN revision it is marked as an alpha.
  Various tidying of display to handle multiple eggs.
  Switched from CHANGES.txt and CONTRIBUTORS.txt to docs/HISTORY.txt
